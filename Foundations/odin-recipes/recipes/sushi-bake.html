    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My housemate introduced me to this dish, which was all over TikTok, and I've been obsessed with this since! I can hardly wait to get it out of the oven every time I make it. Definitely a satisfying meal that I count on to tide me over until the next time I get sushi.</p>
    <p>Serves: 2 people</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 cups of imitation crab, shredded</li>
      <li>1 big fillet of salmon</li>
      <li>1 whole avocado (or more if you prefer, I usually go with 2 as an avocado fan)</li>
      <li>1.5 cups of rice</li>
      <li>Seaweed (both the nori kind or loasted lavers kind is good)</li>
      <li>Optional: Any additional seafood (I've made it with scallops and shrimps as well)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Seasoning & Garnish</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>kewpie mayo</li>
      <li>srriracha or any type of hot sauce you have</li>
      <li>furikake</li>
      <li>sesame oil</li>
      <li>soy sauce</li>
      <li>any seasoning you like for the salmon: I use chili powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the rice in a rice cooker or a pot (look up instructions for this!)</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, season and air fry/ pan fry/ bake the salmon. I usually air fry the salmon at 400 degrees F or 180 degrees C for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway. If you have other seafood you want to use, lightly stir fry them on a pan with the same seasoning until lightly cooked</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350-375 degrees F. Line a baking tray with parchment paper or aluminium foil. When the rice is done cooking, scoop it out into a bowl, mix with sesame oil and furikake, and line the tray with the rice mix.</li>
      <li>In a bowl mix your cooked salmon, shredded imitation crab and seafood together with soysauce, kewpie mayo and srriracha to taste. Mash the salmon up into a mushed texture. Put this mixture on top of the rice</li>
      <li>You can add avocado and seaweed on top if you prefer. Put the tray into the oven to bake for 20 minutes</li>
      <li>After it's baked, drizzle more srriracha and mayo on top, and enjoy the bake by scooping some into pieces of seaweed to serve as a wrap!</li>
    </ol>
