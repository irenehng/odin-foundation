  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This quick and easy dish brings me straight back to my childhood. As a sickly child with an easily swollen tonsil and weak digestive system (yes I was a menace to feed), this soup is one of the dishes I lived on and deeply enjoy, both in sickness and in health. It's a lifesaving go-to recipe for busy college students!</p>
  <p>Serves: 2 people</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3-4 Eggs (lightly beaten)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>Chicken stock</li>
    <li>Optional: Seaweed</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Seasoning & Garnish</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>white pepper</li>
    <li>Optional: MSG</li>
    <li>sesame oil</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>green onions</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a pot, stir in the sesame oil, white pepper, and MSG. Season to your preferences.</li>
    <li>Mix cornstarch and water in a separate bowl to make cornstarch slurry, and add this to the soup, stirring it continuously as you do so. You can add more or less starch according to the soup consistency you prefer</li>
    <li>Beat the eggs lightly, and stir the eggs into the soup. The speed at which you do this will determine if you get large or small egg swirls. Remember to stir the soup in a circular motion as you drizzle in the egg</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil and it's done! Top with green onions and serve</li>
  </ol>
