  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Me and my housemate's go-to recipe when we want something quick and hearty after a long school day.</p>
  <p>Serves: 2 people</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2-1 Onions</li>
    <li>Protein of choice (spam or pork belly works best!)</li>
    <li>1 cup of kimchi</li>
    <li>1/2-1 pack of soft tofu</li>
    <li>Stock of your choice: You can use dashi, anchovy stock, chicken or vegetable stock. If you don't have any stock handy (I've been there many times), just water + some kimchi juice will turn out just fine!</li>
    <li>Optional: Mushroom, tuna, egg</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Seasoning & Garnish</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>gochujang</li>
    <li>gochugaru (korean red pepper flakes)</li>
    <li>sesame oil</li>
    <li>soy sauce or doenjang (korean soybean paste)</li>
    <li>green onions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Season to your own taste and preferences! That is the way of Asian cooking.</p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add your oil of choice to a pot over medium heat and stir fry the onion and garlic for about 3-4 minutes until golden. Then add your protein and stir frequently until visibly cooked and brown</li>
    <li>I like to remove my meat and keep it on the side to add back later so it stay crispy, but if you like your meat tender, feel free to skip this and keep your meat in the pot</li>
    <li>Add kimchi and kimchi juice, your water or broth, and bring to a boil</li>
    <li>Once the stew starts boiling, add gochugaru and doenjang or soy sauce, then lower the heat and simmer for about 5-8 minutes until the broth looks like your desired consistency</li>
    <li>Add your toppings of choice (tuna, mushrooms, or soft tofu), and cook for another 2 minutes. You can also add your eggs and bury them in the broth so they can cook at this stage if you want</li>
    <li>The stew is done! Garnish with spring onions and enjoy</li>
  </ol>
